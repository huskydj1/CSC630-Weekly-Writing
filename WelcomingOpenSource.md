# Welcoming Open-Source Libraries

##### Community is an important aspect of open-source. Welcoming spaces encourage contributors and collaborators to develop and improve your work. They also motivate feedback and suggestions from new users, prompting new developments and improvements of the code base. This all starts by making your own open-source library inviting and inclusive.

## README
The exact components of a software library's README heavily depends on the library's function and design. However, there are some suggestions that will help most open-source libraries become more appealing and inviting.

### Name
Catchy, easily understandable names elevate open-source libraries, as they allow newcomers to get a broad idea of the repositories immediately upon seeing them show up from a search. If a name becomes too technical or niche, it becomes too difficult for people outside of the inner community/group to grasp the library's purpose. If one becomes to bland and broad, newcomers will have little incentive to navigate to and read through the library. Your repository's name should be catchy, concise, and self-explanatory.

### Description/Examples
Some form of media effectively demonstrating your library's function helps interested newcomers use and contribute to your code. There are a number of ways maintainers can effectively do this. The most common way is to use textual explanations/descriptions, sprinkling in links to background information. Maintainers also frequently add bulleted lists with the project's features. Comparisons between the library and similar alternatives are also helpful in giving the user an understanding of your library's specific use case and purpose.

Graphics are also very helpful in this section. Short gifs demonstrating the features in action or images of a person using the library allows readers to get a stronger grasp on the repositories' contents. [Markdownify](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/electron-markdownify#readme) is an excellent example of a repository that uses text and graphics to describe the library. There are a number of links to specific information people might want. There is also a big graphic of someone using Markdownify to edit their markdown file.

### Installation
Listing specific steps for novices to install and use your code creates a welcoming space for users of all skill/experience levels. An off-putting aspect of using software from Github is often the act of installing and setting up the program. Removing ambiguity by walking the user through the process, especially with regards to particular language versions, operating systems, or dependencies, greatly improves your library and it's inclusiveness.

### Support/Contact
There are a number ways to offer support and help to users. One common way is to include a Frequently Asked Questions section. The exact contents should differ by project, but it is important to consider what a new user might experience. One way you might learn about such a person's struggles is to ask friends to try out your library just from the Github link. Noting their struggles, appreciations, and general feedback will give you a good idea of the kind of questions users may have. You may then improve upon this set of FAQS by adding a survey or form for interested users.

It is also helpful to give users a way to contact you for technical support or general feedback. Open-source is about growth and progress; this isn't possible if users are faced with a stonewall when facing a problem. [Markdownify](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/electron-markdownify#readme), for examples, includes an email for any user's feedback.

[Choo](https://github.com/choojs/choo) implements these techniques very well by adding links at the very top of their README to the project's website, handbook, resources, contributing guidelines, Reddit, and chat. They have created multiple tools to support novices with documentation and guides/tutorials. They have also created a space for the community to interact and help each other. In this way, the maintainers have created a sense of community and inclusiveness for all users and contributors of their repository.

One interesting thing to note about Choo is that they created separate Github repositories for their guide/tutorials and for their documentation. This is frequently done when there is too much content to simply fit into a single README. Other avenues of more documentation are creating a wiki or building a separate website. In many ways, this itself fosters an inclusive space, as it sets aside the technical, nitty-gritty information for experienced users who know what they are looking for. This also creates a cleaner user interface for users to navigate through the repository. Concision is frequently key to attract contributors and newcomers.

### Status
A short section about the repository's status is also helpful if there are specific features in progress or if development is at a halt. Not only does this allow users to understand your project's current capabilities, but this also encourages others to develop your repository. Even after you have moved on to different pursuits, someone might choose to fork your project or step in as a maintainer, allowing further development on your project even after you have run out of steam or interest. You might also include here a request for maintainers, if you require more help.
