# Hacktoberfest

Hacktoberfest is a monthlong, annual event that DigitalOcean, an American cloud infrastructure provider, has held since 2014. Hosted by Github and organized by DigitalOcean, it has a simple premise: anyone who makes four valid pull requests within the month of October will receive a Hacktoberfest shirt. The event has garnered a lot of attention over the years, amassing 483,127 pull requests from participants in 2019.

It is described on [the event page](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) as a "celebration open to everyone in our global community" where people can "make positive contributions to an ever-growing community". The idea is that participants, initially motivated to create pull requests for the t-shirts, will contribute to open-source as a whole, have a long-lasting impact on people and technology, and perhaps go on to work on open-source projects more frequently.

Recently however, many people have taken a harsh, cynical stance on the company and the festival. In the first day of Hacktoberfest 2020, developer and repository maintainer [Andy Allan](https://twitter.com/gravitystorm) took to his blog to call it ["a corporate-sponsored distributed denial of service attack against the open source maintainer community"](https://blog.domenic.me/hacktoberfest/). Within hours of the event's start, he had received 11 spammy pull requests on a single repository by eager t-shirt lovers, sending notifications to all 485 watchers and wasting the maintainers' time. [Without a way to ban spammers](https://twitter.com/MattIPv4/status/1311390054334554113) or to limit the interaction in his repository for more than 24-hours ([which has now been fixed](https://twitter.com/github/status/1311772722234560517)), he pleaded with Github and DigitalOcean to genuinely support open-source by preventing/alleviating this issue.

He wasn't the only person with this problem either. As of October 16, 2020, 444 tweets have been made with the hashtag "#shitoberfest", all criticizing the handling of the event and sharing the spam pull requests that repository maintainers were receiving.

In response to the outrage, DigitalOcean released a [series of updates from October 1st to 3rd](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/hacktoberfest-update) with the goal of reducing spam. Their improvements included:
- making the event opt-in only for repositories
- requiring event-related pull requests to be approved by repository maintainers before they are counted to the contributors' sum
- implementing a banning system for users with many flagged pull requests
- urging participants to read and abide by the rules
